More new art! I just had to get a Seductighoul piece of Vallek and Ravenna!

Love this classic clinch-inspired pose so much ðŸ©· Her makeup and Morticia/Elvira vibes give me liiiife! And that tight taut green tush ðŸ¥° you can check out the goods on the art page of my site and Chuckâ€™s ðŸ¦‹

I love this Chuck masterpiece so much! I imagine that sheâ€™s been sassing and teasing him all day and now itâ€™s finally time to get thrown over his shoulder for some steamy payback.

Vallek & Ravenna are our spicy leads of Faeling, book 4 of the Monstrous World series and out July 25! Preorders up on the Zon now.

Thank you again to Chuck! I adore working with them!
